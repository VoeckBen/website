                <h4>Digital proximity through social intranets<img src="images/gb64.png" width="27px" height="20px" alt="United Kingdom" /></h4>
                <p style="margin-top: -15px;">Even the best social intranets cannot replace the personal exchange of two employees. From meetings to office grapevine, employees are still very much in favor of personal communication instead of modern communication technologies. Nevertheless, chat, facebook-like activity streams, microblogs and video conferencing software are becoming increasingly popular amongst employees. And for a good reason: not because they are sworn to completely replace the face-to-face communication, but because they make communication and collaboration possible where there was not before.</p><p>In a study, MIT professor Thomas J. Allen found that the communication probability of two employees is significantly reduced by their distance to each other. This is not very surprising. In order to get into exchange with one another, one must often be at the same place. Spatial proximity is one of the most important conditions of frequent and productive cooperation. The results were however nevertheless sufficiently astonishing: According to Allen, the communication probability decreases exponentially with distance and the decline starts with a much smaller distance than ever thought before.</p>

                <p style="text-align: right"><small>Allen curve: Probability of weekly communication with increasing distance between two employees.</small></p>
                <p>Two employees having weekly contact with each other, decreases from a spatial distance of the workplace of already 25 meters to each other to just 5 percent. This, of course, has a considerable impact on how information is disseminated in organizations and companies. It does not matter at this distance whether two employees work 35 meters or 35 kilometers apart, the probability remains roughly the same. The relevancy of this find is obvious: Companies are increasingly globally active through the ever-growing international division of labor. Spatial proximity is becoming less and less practicable, especially if one also wants to avoid information silos.</p><p>Here, the social intranets come into play: they do not replace the direct communication between individuals, but increase the communication probability independent of spatial distance. Social intranets generate digital proximity. Activity stream and microblog make information carriers visible outside the immediate environment and chats invite for an easy and informal exchange.</p><p>Although companies are becoming more and more global, the new social intranet communications technologies are bringing people closer together and encouraging exchanges and collaboration within the company, regardless of where they are or companies choose to be located.</p>
